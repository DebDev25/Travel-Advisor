Country: Afghanistan
Reissued after periodic review with updates to reflect the security environment, immigration information, and availability of medical care.
Do not travel to Afghanistan due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism, risk of wrongful detention, kidnapping, and limited health facilities.
Country Summary: The U.S. Embassy in Kabul suspended operations in 2021. The U.S. government is not able to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan.
Multiple terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan and U.S. citizens are targets of kidnapping and hostage-taking. The Taliban have harassed and detained aid and humanitarian workers. The activities of foreigners may be viewed with suspicion, and reasons for detention may be unclear. Even if you are registered with the appropriate authorities to conduct business, the risk of detention is high.

The Department has determined there is a risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals in Afghanistan. Additionally, Afghan-U.S. citizens and U.S. Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) who previously supported the United States (for example, as an interpreter) in Afghanistan may be targeted for detention.
The Taliban do not regularly permit the United States to conduct welfare checks on U.S. citizens in detention, including by phone. Detention can be lengthy. While in detention, U.S. citizens have limited or no access to medical attention and may be subject to physical abuse.
U.S. citizens should not travel to Afghanistan for any reason, including to accompany eligible family members for relocation. U.S. citizens or LPRs do not have to be physically present in Afghanistan for their qualifying family members to receive such assistance. For further information on how to assist your family members with the immigrant visa application process or to request relocation assistance for family, please refer to our website.
U.S. citizens in Afghanistan are urged to depart immediately via commercial means if possible. U.S. citizens who are seeking U.S. government assistance to depart should email complete biographic details and contact information (email and phone number), as well as U.S. passport number, to AfghanistanACS@state.gov.
Basic medical care is available in major Afghan cities such as Kabul but is limited in rural areas.

Country: Bangladesh
Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.
Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

 Level 4: Do Not Travel

The Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks.

Country Summary: Since summer 2024, civil unrest and violent clashes have largely subsided with the formation of the Interim Government.  Occasional protests continue with potential for violent clashes.  Conditions may change on short notice.  U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning.
Travelers should be aware of petty crime, such as pickpocketing in crowded areas.  In addition, crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute most criminal activity in Bangladesh’s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are targeted because of their nationality.  These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.
There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Bangladesh.  Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more.
Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh are prohibited from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave.
Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Dhaka. Authorization is not required for travel to Cox’s Bazar or Sylhet.
The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka, due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Bangladesh.
If you decide to travel to Bangladesh:

Avoid demonstrations and political gatherings; demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and quickly escalate into violence.

Country: Cuba
Updated to reflect information on power grid failures and Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) licenses for travel.
Exercise increased caution in Cuba due to crime and unreliable electrical power.
Country Summary: Petty crime is a risk for travelers in Cuba. This includes pick pocketing, purse snatchings, and car break-ins. Violent crime, including armed robbery and homicide, is also on the rise in Cuba.
U.S. law and regulation prohibit travel to, from, or within Cuba for tourist activities. OFAC regulates travel to, from, and within Cuba by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction, defined to include, among other things, all U.S. citizens or residents (wherever located) and anyone in the United States, regardless of their citizenship and nationality. Failure by a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to act consistently with the regulations may result in penalties and criminal prosecution. Travel to Cuba without an OFAC license is illegal.
Cuba's electrical supply is unreliable. Since October 2024, there have been several prolonged nationwide power outages. Scheduled and unscheduled power cuts lasting up to 12 hours occur daily in Havana, and even longer outside the capital. Some large businesses, hotels, hospitals, and institutions use generators during power outages. However, they may have trouble keeping the generators running during a long outage due to the inconsistent and scarce availability of fuel.
U.S. citizens in Cuba or those planning to visit should check local news often to stay up to date. In Cuba, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests or demonstrations.
U.S. Embassy employees must follow a special notification process with the Government of Cuba to travel outside of Havana. This process can impact the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in Cuba during emergencies.
If a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction travels to Cuba consistent with 1 of the 12 travel categories authorized by a general OFAC license, the person would not need to apply for a specific OFAC license for the travel transactions. For non-tourist travel that is not otherwise covered by a general license, a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction must seek a specific license from OFAC to authorize the travel. For travel questions, check 31 C.F.R. 515.560 and OFAC’s Frequently Asked Questions.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Cuba.
If you decide to travel to Cuba:

Stay aware of your surroundings.
Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.
Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.
Prepare for prolonged power outages by:
Keeping mobile phones and portable battery banks charged.
Having flashlights and spare batteries easily accessible.
Stocking up on nonperishable food and water.
Preparing alternative methods to meet your medical needs (medical devices requiring power, medicines requiring refrigeration, etc.)


Obtain any required OFAC licenses as it is illegal to travel to Cuba without an appropriate license.

Violations of Indian immigration laws are taken very seriously. India may imprison, fine, or deny entry to travelers without valid documents or the correct type of visa.
Electronic visas are not accepted for land border crossings into India. Even those with physical visas have faced issues, including detention and hefty court expenses, due to misunderstandings over permitted travel and durations of stay.
If you choose to cross the India-Nepal land border, be advised to use caution and obey all immigration requirements.

Country: Iran
Updated to reflect changes to the “If you decide to travel to Iran” section, add warnings about Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and surrogacy, and updated information on detention risks.
Do not travel to Iran due to the risk of terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, arbitrary arrest of U.S. citizens, and wrongful detention.
Country Summary: Do not travel to Iran for any reason. U.S. citizens in Iran face serious dangers. They have been kidnapped and wrongfully arrested. Some have been held for years on false charges, subjected to psychological torture, and even sentenced to death. The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran.  
The Department of State has determined that U.S. nationals traveling to Iran are at significant risk of wrongful detention.  Iranian authorities continue to unjustly detain U.S. nationals without warning or any evidence they committed a crime.  This includes dual U.S.-Iranian nationals, students, journalists, business travelers, academics, and individuals with U.S. military or government experience.  Charges include espionage and posing a threat to national security.  U.S. nationals are at significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran.  Having a U.S. passport or connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone.
Iranian authorities routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. nationals.  In particular, Iranian authorities consistently deny consular access to dual U.S.-Iranian nationals.
Terrorism
Violent extremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate in Iran.  ISIS and related groups have taken responsibility for bombings and other attacks in the country.  The risk of terrorism and deadly harm to bystanders continues.
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and Surrogacy
Companies offering surrogacy services in Iran are grossly misrepresenting the security situation in Iran and risks of the unregulated surrogacy tourism industry.  Private companies that organize these visits and services put U.S. citizens in danger.  Iranian surrogacy providers have also been known to misrepresent U.S. citizenship law; if a child born overseas to a surrogate is not genetically or gestationally related to a U.S. citizen parent or the spouse of a U.S. citizen, the child will not automatically acquire U.S. citizenship at birth and will not be able to obtain a U.S. passport to leave Iran.
Aviation Safety Oversight
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) that bans U.S. flights to, from, or through Iran’s airspace.  This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or near Iran.   U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices for more information.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Iran.
If you decide to travel to Iran:

Review your personal security plan and visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.
Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Iranian nationality.
Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.
Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your loved ones to access them.
Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones.  This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).
Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones.  This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.  Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.
Check local media for breaking events.  Be prepared to adjust your plans.
Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help.
Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts from the Department. It makes it easier to locate you in an emergency.
Visit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel and return to the United States.

Country: Iraq
Updated to reflect the lifting of ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel.
Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and the U.S. government’s limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq. Do not travel to Iraq for any reason.
Country Summary: U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks, including violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas, including major cities. The Department of State requires U.S. government personnel in Iraq to live and work under strict security due to serious threats. 
There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Iraq. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s country reports on terrorism to learn more.
Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turn violent.
Do not travel near armed groups or Iraq’s northern borders due to:

Continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups
Armed conflict
Aerial bombardment
Civil unrest

U.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines. Read the Syria Travel Advisory for more information.
Because of security concerns, U.S. government personnel in Baghdad are prohibited from using Baghdad International Airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of Iraq. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Iraq.
If you decide to travel to Iraq:

Establish a personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.
Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them for identification purposes.
Have departure plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.
Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.

Israel – Reconsider Travel (see below for additional information regarding areas near the Lebanese and Syrian borders)
Reconsider travel due to terrorism, and civil unrest.
The security situation in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem is unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire and armed UAV intrusions and missiles, can take place without warning.
U.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:

Within 11.3 kilometers/seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line; and
Northern Israel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian border due to continued military presence and activity

Any official travel of U.S. government personnel within these areas requires approval from the Embassy’s security office.
Additional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.
Northern Israel (within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel
The Israeli authorities restrict travel to areas close to the border given the Israeli Defense Forces continued presence and activity.  Do not travel to this area for any reason.
Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel are currently restricted from personal travel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.  Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel must obtain special authorization to travel close to these borders.
The U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens not travel within 4 kilometers/2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders.
West Bank – Reconsider Travel
Reconsider Travel due to terrorism and civil unrest.
Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Israel must obtain special authorization travel to the West Bank. U.S. government employees are currently restricted from all personal travel to the West Bank, except:

U.S. government employees can use Routes 1, 90, and 443 at any time. 
U.S. government employees are permitted personal daylight travel to Jericho and Bethlehem, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. Given continued closures of checkpoints throughout the West Bank, the only permitted and accessible route into Bethlehem for U.S. government employees and their family members is through Checkpoint 300 near Rachel’s Tomb. 

Over the past several months, there has been an increase in violence, Israeli military operations, and terrorist attacks. Some incidents have resulted in injury or death of U.S. citizens.

Country: Kenya
Updated to include a risk indicator for health and to reflect additional safety and security information.
Do Not Travel to:

Kenya-Somalia border counties (Garissa, Wajir, Mandera), Tana River County, and coastal areas north of Malindi due to terrorism and kidnapping;
West Pokot and western Turkana County due to banditry;
Parts of Marsabit and Turkana Counties within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of the Ethiopian border due to cross-border incursions.

Reconsider Travel to:

The Nairobi neighborhoods of Eastleigh and Kibera due to crime and kidnapping.

Country Summary:  Violent crime, such as armed carjacking, mugging, home invasion, and kidnapping, can occur at any time. Local police often lack the capability to respond effectively to serious crimes and terrorist attacks.  Emergency medical and fire services are limited. Avoid traveling after dark in Kenya due to crime and poor traffic safety.
Crime
Motorycle crimes are common, where thieves grab items from victims and are able to quickly flee the scene. Crimes typically occur in crowded areas or when people are distracted. Police have limited ability to respond to these crimes.  Handbags, mobile phones, and other easy-to-reach valuables are the most stolen items.
Terrorism
Terrorist attacks have occurred with little or no warning. They have targeted:

Kenyan and foreign government buildings,
Tourist locations,
Transportation hubs,
Hotels and resorts,
Markets and shopping malls, and
Places of worship.

Terrorist acts have included armed assaults, suicide operations, bomb or grenade attacks, and kidnappings.
Demonstrations
Demonstrations, strikes, and other political and economic protests are common. They often block key intersections or highways, resulting in widespread traffic jams. Violence during demonstrations has occurred across the country. This includes rock-throwing and police using deadly force. Political violence is most common in western Kenya and Nairobi.
Health 
Access to medical care in Kenya is limited and medical facilities may not have adequate supply of medicine, especially outside large cities. Medical evacuation insurance valid for travel to Kenya is strongly recommended. Hospitals usually require payment before treatment. 
Unlicensed facilities and bribes
Some schools and behavior modification facilities in Kenya operate without licensing and oversight. Reports of U.S. citizens being held against their will or being physically abused in these facilities are common. The embassy has also received numerous reports from young adults whose U.S. passports were taken away by their families.
The embassy frequently receives complaints from U.S. citizens about being stopped by police or immigration or customs officials asking for bribes.
Property confiscations
Property disputes are common and can turn violent. Some U.S. citizens have had their property confiscated or been threatened.

Transportation hubs
Public places where crowds gather

Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more.
Gangs and crime
Civil unrest and armed gangs are active in parts of Southern Nigeria. This is especially true in the Niger Delta and Southeast regions. Armed crime and gangs are common in the area. Crimes include kidnapping and assaults on Nigerian security services.
Violence can flare up between communities of farmers and herders in rural areas.
Unreliable health care
U.S. citizens should not expect the same level of health care to be available in Nigeria as they do in the United States:

Nigerian medical facilities are generally not equipped to U.S. or European standards.
Many medicines are not available. This includes common medications for diabetes or asthma.
Bring enough over-the-counter and prescription medicines to last your entire stay in Nigeria.
Update vaccinations to include all standard vaccinations, plus yellow fever, meningitis, typhoid, cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and a polio booster.

Most hospitals and doctors do not accept U.S. health insurance.
Emergency services like those in the United States or Europe do not exist.
Blood supply is often unreliable.
Ambulance services are unreliable, have poor equipment, and often do not have trained paramedics.
We strongly recommend getting traveler’s insurance, including medical evacuation insurance, before traveling.
The Department of State does not pay medical bills for U.S. citizens overseas.
U.S. Medicare/Medicaid do not work overseas.

Due to security risks, U.S. government employees cannot provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Nigeria.

Country: Pakistan
Reissued after periodic review with minor edits.
Reconsider travel to Pakistan due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.  Some areas have increased risk.  Read the entire Travel Advisory.
Do Not Travel to: 

Balochistan Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, which include the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism.
The immediate vicinity of the India-Pakistan border and the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.

Country Summary: Violent extremist groups continue to plot attacks in Pakistan.  Terrorist attacks are frequent in Balochistan Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP), which include the former FATA.  Large-scale terrorist attacks have resulted in numerous casualties, and small-scale attacks are frequent.  Terrorism and ongoing violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian, as well as local military and police targets.  Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist attractions, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities.  Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. 
Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit.  Being near a protest can draw scrutiny from Pakistani security forces.  U.S. citizens have been detained for participating in protests and for posting content on social media perceived as critical of the Pakistani government, military, or officials.  Internet and mobile phone service outages are common, especially during protests.  
Pakistan’s security environment remains fluid, sometimes changing with little or no notice.  There are greater security resources and infrastructure in the major cities, particularly Islamabad, and security forces in these areas may be more readily able to respond to an emergency compared to other areas of the country.
The government of Pakistan restricts the travel of U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan.  The U.S. government has limited ability to provide services to U.S. citizens in the KP Province, Balochistan Province, Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir, and most areas outside of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi.  Due to the risks, U.S. government personnel working in Pakistan must obtain special authorization to travel to most areas outside of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi.  
The U.S. Embassy and Consulates require U.S. government personnel to use armed escorts and armored vehicles when traveling in certain parts of the country, both for official and personal travel.  Additional restrictions on movements can occur suddenly and at any time, depending on local circumstances and security conditions.  U.S. government personnel on assignment in Pakistan are prohibited from attending most large gatherings.
The U.S. Embassy and Consulates have a limited ability to provide consular services to dual U.S.-Pakistani citizens who have been arrested or detained. Pakistani law considers such individuals to be exclusively citizens of Pakistan. 
The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar does not provide consular services.  Services for U.S. citizens are available from the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi, and the U.S. Consulate General in Lahore.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Pakistan. 
If you decide to travel to Pakistan:

Do not travel to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which includes the former FATA, for any reason.  Active terrorist and insurgent groups routinely conduct attacks against civilians, non-governmental organizations, government offices, and security forces.  These groups historically have targeted both government officials and civilians.  Assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, including the targeting of polio eradication teams and Government of Pakistan security service (police and military) personnel.
Visit our website for Travel to High-Risk Areas.  
Vicinity of Line of Control – Level 4: Do Not Travel 
Do not travel to the India-Pakistan border, including areas along the Line of Control for any reason.  Militant groups are known to operate in the area. India and Pakistan maintain a strong military presence on their respective sides of the border.  The only official Pakistan-India border crossing point for persons who are not citizens of India or Pakistan is in the Province of Punjab between Wagah, Pakistan, and Atari, India.  Travelers are advised to confirm the status of the border crossing prior to commencing travel.  An Indian visa is required to enter India, and no visa services are available at the border.

Country: Russian Federation
Reissued after periodic review.
Do not travel to Russia due to:

Danger associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine.
The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials.
The arbitrary enforcement of local laws.
The possibility of terrorism.

U.S. citizens in Russia should leave immediately.
The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff and the Russian government has restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services. Do not travel to Russia for any reason.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has limited ability to assist in the case of a detention of a U.S. citizen. There is no guarantee that a U.S. citizen will be afforded consular access or released before their entire prison sentence is served. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.
Russian officials have questioned and threatened U.S. citizens without reason. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence. Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens for their religious activities.
There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine, and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for the attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow that killed 130 people, as well as attacks in Dagestan targeting places of worship. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.
Dual citizenship
Russia will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship.

Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.
The Russian government has forced people with dual citizenship to join the military and has stopped them from leaving the country.
In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.

Demonstrations
In Russia, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media.
Electronic devices
Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.
Debit and credit cards
U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible.
Air travel
There are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time.
Click here for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns. U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns.
Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.
Laws and special circumstances
Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips.

U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.
Russian authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance.
Russian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered “undesirable.”
Russian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law.

Security
There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.
Russia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar.
Under martial law, authorities can:

Set curfews
Seize property
Restrict movement
Detain foreigners
Forcibly relocate residents
Limit public gatherings

Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting "anti-Russian" groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military.
LGB travelers
The Russian government's current "propaganda" law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime.
Terrorism
Terrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly.
U.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus.
Russian annexation of territories
The international community does not recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya.
Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions.
Russian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia’s authority.
The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.
If you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia:

The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant.
Be ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.
Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.
Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.
Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.
Develop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you'll confirm you're safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.
Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Read the information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas.
Visit our website on Travel to High-Risk areas.
Consider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Russian nationality.
Log out of all social media accounts and do not access your social media accounts while in Russia.
Keep travel documents up-to-date and easily accessible.
Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.

Country: Saudi Arabia
Updated to reflect current security conditions and other minor edits.
Exercise increased caution in Saudi Arabia due to the threat of missile and drone attacks from Yemen and terrorism. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. Be aware of risks concerning social media activity and importation of prohibited items.
Do not travel to the following locations due to the threat of missile and drone attacks and terrorism:

Within 20 miles of the Saudi-Yemen border, including the city of Najran
Qatif in the Eastern Province and its suburbs, including Awamiyah.

Country Summary: U.S. Embassy and Consulate personnel must adhere to the above travel restrictions. The U.S. government has limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in the above locations.
The Houthis have perpetrated missile and drone attacks in Saudi Arabia. Attacks have been rare since the announcement of a truce between Saudi Arabia, the Houthi rebels, and the internationally recognized Government of Yemen. Recent Houthi attacks have focused on vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes. The Houthis have also threatened to renew attacks against Saudi Arabia. Past attacks have been aimed at targets throughout the country. Cities, infrastructure, airports, military bases and energy facilities have all been targeted.  
Debris from intercepted drones and missiles has also been a risk. U.S. citizens living and working near infrastructure and military bases and infrastructure are at increased risk if attacks reoccur. The risk is most pronounced near the border with Yemen.
Terrorism continues to be a concern in Saudi Arabia. Attacks can occur with little or no warning. Terrorists have targeted Saudi and international interests. Religious sites and other places frequented by U.S. citizens have been targeted. Globally, terrorists are using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles. Targets often include tourist locations, large gatherings, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, and government facilities. Terrorists are also known to time attacks around major holidays and/or in response to military operations.
Social media activity Saudi authorities deem critical, offensive, or disruptive to public order, could lead to arrest. U.S. citizens have been arrested for past social media activity and comments made while outside of Saudi Arabia. This may include posting, re-posting, or liking comments critical of Saudi institutions, policies, or public life. Saudi laws on cybercrime and terrorism are used to prosecute these cases. Punishment for social media activity has included prison sentences of up to 45 years. Saudi courts do not necessarily consider the timeframe of the posts, or the location from which they were made, to be material.
It is illegal to bring drugs (including marijuana), drug paraphernalia, or alcohol into Saudi Arabia. Importing gambling-related items, weapons, or pork is prohibited. Bringing materials that could be considered obscene or suggestive into Saudi Arabia is also prohibited. Penalties are severe by U.S. standards. For more information, please see the Saudi Arabia Customs Authority website.
Due to risks to civil aviation operating within the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman region, including Saudi Arabia, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued an advisory Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM). For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.

Periodic violence between Thai security services and armed insurgents has been known to occur in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat. Seventeen districts in these provinces remain under a declared state of emergency due to ongoing violent conflict. There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand’s southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict.

Security forces have detained tens of thousands of people, including U.S. citizens, for alleged ties to terrorist groups based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated.  U.S. citizens have also been subject to exit bans that prevent them from departing Türkiye. Protests not approved by the Turkish government can lead to arrest, as can criticizing the government, including on social media.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Türkiye.

Country: Ukraine
Reissued with updates after periodic review.
Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia’s war against Ukraine. The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine’s border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy’s ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory.
Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.
Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. 
Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.
All U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.
U.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications – which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor – that announce air alerts in real time, such as Air Raid Siren and Alarm Map. The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.
On February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.
Ukrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our Travelers with Dual Nationality page.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.
U.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email KyivACS@state.gov. Please review what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas.
The Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv.
Occupied Territories:
Most of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia’s occupation.
There are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.
Although Russia’s occupation severely restricts the Embassy’s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.
Read the country information page for additional information on travel to Ukraine.
Travel to High-Risk Areas:
If you choose to travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:

Visit our website on Travel to High-Risk areas.
Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.
Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
